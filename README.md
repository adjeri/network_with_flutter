Connecting to the World. This app fetches data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts and displays them in a ListView.

## Description

In my learning of Flutter, this project is an application that fetches data from  an API and displays the result in a list view.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
